    <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
    <main>
        <dt><strong>What is a yurt?</strong></dt>
            <dd>
            Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground.
            Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor,
             and a roof dome that can be opened.
            </dd>
        <dt><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></dt>
            <dd>
            Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove.
             Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold
              running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.
            </dd>
        <dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>
            <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing
                 weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight
                  and a sense of adventure!
